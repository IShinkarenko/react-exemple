To the extent permitted under law (and unless Expandigo has entered into a separate written agreement that overrides this agreement), Expandigo and its affiliates (and those that Expandigo works with to provide the services) shall not be liable to you or others for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of data, opportunities, reputation, profits or revenues, related to the services (e.g. offensive or defamatory statements, down time or loss, use of, or changes to, your information or content).
In no event shall the liability of Expandigo and its affiliates (and those that Expandigo works with to provide the services) exceed, in the aggregate for all claims, an amount that is the lesser of (a) five times the most recent monthly or yearly fee that you paid for a paid service, if any, or b) a maximum of US$1,000. 
This limitation of liability is part of the basis of the bargain between you and Expandigo and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g. warranty, tort, negligence, agreement, law) and even if Expandigo or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
Some laws do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability, so these limits may not apply to you.
